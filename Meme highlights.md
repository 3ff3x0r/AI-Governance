The famous researcher on AI professor Stuart Russel published on his [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/stuartjonathanrussell_by-monday-californias-governor-gavin-newsom-activity-7245474519958589440-4vyV) a short piece in favor of SB1047 that is deeply interwided with the kind of memes that ilustrate quite well how these discourses are used instrumentaly.

| **Mythological-Narrative Templates** | **Creation Narratives**           | - *"If they succeed in their stated goal of creating superhuman AI systems…" (AI as a creation of human ambition)*     | Depicts AI development as a bold, perhaps reckless act of creation, akin to the Prometheus myth of creating something that could overwhelm humanity.        |
|                                   | **Prophetic Warnings**            | - *"The human era may well come to an end."*<br>- *"A risk of human extinction ranging from 10% to 30%."*             | A Cassandra-like warning, foretelling disastrous consequences due to AI, often accompanied by fatalistic language and quantification of risks.             |
| **Economic Ideologies** | **Technological Hegemony**        | - *"Reckless race for dominance."*<br>- *"Regulation stifles innovation."*<br>- *"Kill startups" and “hand the AI race to China on a plate.”* | Frames AI development as a high-stakes race for technological superiority, where regulations threaten to slow down progress, empowering rival nations or large corporations. |
|                                   | **Democratization vs. Centralization** | - *"Hand the AI race to China."*                                               | Reflects tensions between central control and market freedom, with debates about whether global regulations (especially from places like the EU or California) could centralize AI power, limiting innovation. |
| **Socio-Ideological Constructs**   | **AI as Potential Threat**        | - *"Playing Russian roulette with humanity as the victim."*<br>- *"A risk of human extinction ranging from 10% to 30%."* | Positions AI as a potential existential threat, framing it as a weapon that could lead to humanity's downfall if left unchecked. |


On the other side, in tyhis article on [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/from-sci-fi-to-state-law-californias-plan-to-prevent-ai-catastrophe/) we can find similar framing:

| **Economic Ideologies**            | **Market Efficiency Framework**          | - *"Could ruin California's and the US's technological advantage."*                                                      | Highlights fears that over-regulation could cripple the economy, preventing California from maintaining its technological dominance.                        |
|                                   | **Democratization vs. Centralization**   | - *"SB-1047 would essentially kill open source AI and significantly slow down or stop AI innovation."*                    | Suggests that regulation might centralize power in large tech companies, undermining grassroots innovation by restricting open-source development.           |
| **Socio-Ideological Constructs**   | **AI as Potential Threat**               | - *"The bill critiques 'outlandish fears' of future AI systems resembling science fiction."*<br>- *"A shift toward regulating present dangers like deepfake pornography."* | Reflects the fear of AI as a potential societal threat, with critics prioritizing real-world harms over theoretical future risks, such as misuse of AI for harm. |
|                                   | **AI as Evolutionary Step**              | - *"SB-1047 focuses on the regulation of ‘autonomous’ AI behavior..."*                                                   | The debate over AI autonomy suggests a view of AI as a technological evolution, with the regulatory conversation indicating AI’s progression toward greater independence. |


Governor Gavin Newsom [vetoed SB 1047](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SB-1047-Veto-Message.pdf), arguing that the bill’s emphasis on large-scale models ignored the potential risks posed by smaller AI systems. Smaller models, which may operate with less oversight but still wield significant societal impact, could fall outside the purview of the legislation. Newsom suggested that this focus could create a false sense of security, leaving other threats unaddressed. Also,  California’s position as a global leader in AI innovation played a crucial role in the decision. Newsom expressed concerns that stringent regulations could deter investment and slow technological advancements in the state, potentially allowing competitors in other regions or countries to outpace California in AI development.

| **Mythological-Narrative Templates** | **Creation Narratives**                | - *"The Governor emphasizes that the innovation in AI is based on freedom of thought and experimentation."*                    | The narrative of "intellectual freedom" suggests a Promethean-like perspective where the California spirit of innovation and experimentation is sacred and essential. |
| **Economic Ideologies** | **Technological Hegemony**              | - *"The Governor highlights California's leading role in global AI innovation and warns that regulation could slow technological advancement."* | This view mirrors concerns around technological hegemony, where the state is concerned that stringent regulation could erode California's global technological leadership in AI. It suggests that global innovation ecosystems like Silicon Valley are sensitive to regulatory shifts. |
|                                  | **Democratization vs. Centralization** | - *"The Governor warns that stringent regulation could concentrate power within large corporations rather than the open-source community."* | This reflects the debate between democratizing innovation (e.g., open-source) versus centralizing control (e.g., large corporations). The Governor's veto suggests a preference for a more distributed approach to innovation and regulation in AI development. |
